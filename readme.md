A Task Management System is a platform that allows users to create, organize, and manage tasks or projects. It typically involves the following key features:

1. User Authentication & Roles

   Authentication: Users need to log in to access the system. You can use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or sessions to manage user authentication.
   Roles: Different types of users (Admin, Manager, User) with varying levels of access.
   Admin: Can manage users, view all tasks, and perform administrative actions.
   Manager: Can create and manage tasks, assign tasks to users, and update progress.
   User: Can view tasks assigned to them and update their status (e.g., completed, pending).

2. Task Creation

   Project: A task typically belongs to a project. Each project can have multiple tasks.
   Task Details: A task includes details such as the title, description, due date, priority, and assigned user.
   Task Status: The system should track the status of tasks (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Completed").

3. Task Assignment

   Assign Tasks: Managers can assign tasks to specific users (Team Members).
   View Assigned Tasks: Users can view the tasks assigned to them and update their status.

4. Task Prioritization & Deadlines

   Users can prioritize tasks based on urgency (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and set deadlines for each task.

5. Task Updates

   Status Change: As users work on tasks, they can update the status (e.g., from "To Do" to "In Progress").
   Comments/Notes: Users can add comments or notes to tasks to communicate progress or provide additional information.

6. Search and Filtering

   Users should be able to search for tasks by project, priority, deadline, or status.
   Filters allow users to easily find tasks that are overdue, due soon, or not started yet.

7. Dashboard

   Admin Dashboard: Displays an overview of all tasks, users, and project statuses.
   User Dashboard: Displays tasks assigned to the user, upcoming deadlines, and tasks to be completed.

8. Notifications (Optional)

   Users can receive notifications for tasks due soon, new assignments, or updates made by others.

9. Data Persistence

   Database: The system stores all tasks, users, and project data in a database. This could be MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL/MySQL (SQL), depending on your preference.
   Task History: The system should keep a history of task updates, such as when it was created, updated, or completed.

10. APIs

    If you're building a backend API, you will need routes for:
    Creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
    User authentication and management.
    Assigning users to tasks.
    Filtering and searching tasks.

In summary, your Task Management System will allow teams to collaborate efficiently by organizing tasks within projects, assigning responsibilities, tracking progress, and setting deadlines. You'll work with user roles to manage permissions and provide the right level of access to each user.
